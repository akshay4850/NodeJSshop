Course project for Udemy's [NodeJS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

In this Node.js/Express online store application, I make use of a variety of technologies and techniques including the MVC design pattern, REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, MongoDB (and Mongoose), SQL (and Sequelize), handling online payments (including Stripe checkout), WebSockets & Socket.IO, authentication, and testing with Mocha. The code is refactored numerous times to try different approaches.
